# Bark

BARK! is a virtual pet web application created with the intention of providing inexpensive, accessible, and low-maintenance support for one's mental health. We came to the conclusion of a virtual pet after researching the emotional support animal (ESA) field and its many shortcomings. BARK! was built with Javascript, using React and Firebase libraries. To continue working on this project, clone the GitHub repository and add any desired changes to the codebase.
